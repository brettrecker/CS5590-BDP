Well
This is what it looks like right before you fall
Stumblin' around, you been guessing your direction
Next step, you can't see at all
And I don't have a name, I don't have a name, no
Who am I to blame? Who am I to blame though?
And I cannot be changed, I cannot be changed, no
Trust me I've tried
I just end up right at the start of the line
Drawing circles
Mm
Well, I drink my whiskey, and you sip your wine
We're doing well, sitting, watching the world falling down, its decline
And I can keep you safe, I can keep you safe, mm
Do not be afraid, do not be afraid
You're feeling sorry, I'm feeling fine
Don't you put any more stress on yourself, it's one day at a time
It's gettin' pretty late, gettin' pretty late
Yeah, and I find
It goes around like the hands that keep counting the time
Drawing circles
